### Expectations ###

#### 1. Team Meetings ####
All team members must attend all team meetings unless noted otherwise by the project managers or mentor. If a team member cannot make a team meeting for any reason, they must contact a project manager right away. In addition, if a team member misses a meeting, they will be responsible for knowing what was done, needed, or accomplished in that meeting by reading the meeting notes and/or contacting another team member. The structure of meetings is defined in the  meeting notes template in the team Github repo.

#### 2. Meeting Preparation and Participation ####
All team members must be prepared and actively particpating in team meetings to the best of their ability in order to improve and develop ideas. This inlcudes but is not limited to the following activities: completing expected work before meeting, being aware of upcoming assignments and due dates, and contributing to conversation.

#### 3. Communication and Transparency ####
All team members must communicate to each other in a calm and respectful manner no matter what the situation is or what is being discussed. No team member should "call out" another team member in a rude manner. In addition, all team members must be honest and transparent on what they are working on and explain their work to other team members if needed. This includes keeping other team members informed on any type of developments.

#### 4. Individual Work ####
All team members are responsible for completing their assigned work by the project managers to the best of their ability by its required deadline. Team members are responsbile for getting their assigned worked done so if a team member does not know how to do something, the team member must contact a TA, resolve through the internet, or ask other team members for help. 

### 5. Decision Making ###
Project decisions will be made through a majority rules format with at least one project manager agreeing with the decision. 

<br />

### Conflict Resolution ###

#### Expectations not being met ####
If a team member is not meeting expectations, they will be contacted by a project manager through Slack to resolve the issue. If the team member continues to not meet expectations without explanation, both project managers will have a one-on-one video chat with that team member. If further issues arise, the project managers will reach out to the team's mentor. If a project manager is not reaching expectations, team members are expected to reach out to the project manager directly or the other project manager to resolve the issue. If further issues arise, team members will reach out to the team's mentor.

#### Disagreements about the project ####
Project decisions will be determined by expectation number 5 and if a team member has an issue with decisions they can reach out to the project managers privately. If a team member still has an issue they can reach out the team's mentor.

#### Conflicts between team members ####
First and foremost if there are any conflicts between team members then those team members should resolve the conflict amongst themselves. If there are problem between team members, the team members that have the conflict should bring it up to the project managers to resolve the issue. If the project managers sense a conflict between team members they are expected to check with team members too see if there are any issues. If there are conflicts between project managers, the project managers will reach out the team's mentor for advice.
