# STOP Button Functionality

## Context and problem statement
We want to decide how the STOP button should act.

## Considered options
1. STOP button simply pauses the timer, without changing any other values.
2. STOP button does a soft reset, which resets the timer back to the initial work period, but not the estimated pomos of the current task.
3. STOP button does a hard reset, which resets the timer back to the initial work period AND deletes the current task.
## Decision outcome
Chosen option: Decision not made yet.
