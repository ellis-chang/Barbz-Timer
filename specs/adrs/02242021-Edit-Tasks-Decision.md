# Allow users to edit their task list

## Context and problem statement
We want to decide whether or not users should edit their task lists by moving tasks up and down on the list.

## Considered options
1. Do not let the user move items in the list.
2. Let the user move items in the list by dragging and dropping.
3. Let the user move items in the list by using arrow keys.

## Decision outcome
Chosen option: Number 3, because:
  * The easiest way to move items may be through arrow keys. This may be changed if we decide that dragging and dropping is easiest.
  * This decision will make it so that users have more freedom to change the order they do things.
  * This decision keeps in spirit with the pomodoro philosophy, since the users are still made to do these tasks, they can just change the order they do them.
