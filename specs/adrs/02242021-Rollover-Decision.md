# Allow user to delete tasks

## Context and problem statement
We want to decide whether or not the user should be able to delete tasks.

## Considered options
1. We do not implement this feature
2. We implement this feature by adding a delete button to the task list.

## Decision outcome
Chosen option: Number 2, because:
* This decision will allow users more fliexibility with the order they do tasks.
* If the user accidentally adds a task that they longer wish to complete for whatever reason, they can easily remove it.
* Gives the user more control over handling tasks.
